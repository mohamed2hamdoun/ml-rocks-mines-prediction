# Project Title (e.g., House Price Prediction using Machine Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to [state goal clearly, e.g., predict house prices based on various features].  
It was built by following the tutorial SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python (https://youtu.be/fiz1ORTBGpY?si=MksTLhAeQy1nIScX) for learning purposes.
